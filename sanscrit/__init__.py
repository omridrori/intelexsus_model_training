"""
Sanskrit NLP Production Package

This package contains reusable preprocessing utilities, modelâ€“training
routines and CLI entry-points for building and fine-tuning language models
for Sanskrit (and, in the future, Tibetan).  Import modules such as
`sanscrit.preprocessing` or `sanscrit.model` in your scripts instead of
copy-pasting code.
